Exercises for Golang's Concurrency Patterns.

# Rules
1. *Only edit `main.go`* to solve the problems. Do not touch any of the other files.
2. *Do not publish* any solutions, instead join us on [Slack](https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/)! I'm sure there will be people who are happy to give you some code review (if not, find me via @beertocode ;) )
